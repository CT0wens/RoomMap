/**
 * Application class for RoomMap. This application is used to evaluate field measurements made with REW and
 * exported there as text files. The file name has to contain the coordinates of the measurement mic
 * position (x,y,z) separated by spaces (see examples folder).
 * 
 * The SPL distribution is shown at a specific height (adjust with slider) and at a specific frequency (adjust with slider 
 * or text input). The graph shows the pressure (SPL) distribution interpolated among the data points (shown as gray dots),
 * visualized from blue (lowest level) to red (highest level).
 * 
 * Just try it with the delivered examples: When the program asks you for files, select all
 * files inside one example folder and hit OK. 
 * 
 * Dependencies to external libraries/sources: 
 * - CONRAD, a biomedical library which is being used here for thin plate spline interpolation in 3D. Just the necessary 
 *   classes are included as source, slightly modified to kill eclipse warnings.
 * - rainbowvis: This is also included as source, and used for Color interpolation. This has also been modified to produce
 *   Color instances instead of CSS strings.
 * - ij.jar: Used by CONRAD, included as jar archive
 * - Jama-1.0.2.jar: Used by CONRAD, included as jar archive
 * - jpop.0.7.5.jar: Used by CONRAD, included as jar archive
 * 
 * TODO:
 * - 3.00 Pre-determine coefficients for interpolation 
 * 				- Only allow integer frequencies
 * - 0.5  add units to values
 * - 1.00 axis legends
 * 
 * - 3.00 !!!! Option: Show aggregated over function of frequency (ngauss, -tanh) 
 * 		- show on f axis also
 * - 1.00 Import image PNG to lay over data
 * - 4.00 visualize in 3d like amroc (one color only, with alpha)
